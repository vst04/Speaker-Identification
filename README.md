# Speaker-Identification
This Python script employs Librosa and TensorFlow Keras for a speaker recognition system. It loads, preprocesses audio data, defines a CNN model, compiles, and trains it. The script evaluates and prints the model accuracy on a test set. Success requires a labeled dataset with organized audio files.
